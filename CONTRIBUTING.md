# Contributing to N64-Covers

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the N64-Covers repository! This document outlines the guidelines for contributing cover art to this project.

## Cover Art Requirements

### Naming Convention

All cover images must follow the N64 full cartridge ID naming convention:

- Name the file using the complete cartridge code (e.g., NUS-NSME-USA)
- Use `.png` format (e.g., `NUS-NSME-USA.png` for Super Mario 64)

### Image Specifications

- **Format**: PNG with transparency (if possible)
- **Resolution**: Recommended 512x512 pixels or higher
- **Aspect ratio**: Preserve the original aspect ratio
- **Quality**: High resolution, clear images preferred

### Finding the Cartridge Code

The full cartridge code can typically be found:
1. On the front label of the cartridge (e.g., NUS-NFXE-USA-1)
2. On the back label of the cartridge
3. On the circuit board of the cartridge
4. From reliable ROM databases
